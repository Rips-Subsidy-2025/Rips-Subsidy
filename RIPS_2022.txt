With reference to Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme, 2022 the State

Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme, 2022
Procedural Guidelines

1 General Investor Guidelines

1. The State envisages the development of a single profile system for each enterprise
(whether as a vendor, taxpayer, or investor) through an enterprise management module.
As the single profile system develops, the State envisages evolving the Common
Application in these Guidelines as the single source of truth for an investor enterprise.
The profile shall be integrated to all concerned departments and all required infom,ation
will be shared searnlessly.

2. Accordingly, these guidelines are meant to offer a simplified understanding of the
infOlmation fields and supporting doc=ents required to be provided by the Enterprise.
The infonnation templates appended to the Guidelines are indicative in their fonnat; the
State is undertaking effort to align the online portal to the appended formats as closely as
possible.

3. Measures shall be taken by the State to ensure that departments are digitally enabled to
integrate into the single profile system, if unable to do so at the time of notification of these
Guidelines. Accordingly, with a view of increasing investor ease, the State may reduce the
attachments required under these Guidelines as various departments integrate into the
single profile system, over time.

4. The entelprise will initiate the application process by filling the 'Common Application'.
The application process is in two phases: Pre-Commercial Production and Post­
Commercial Production.
